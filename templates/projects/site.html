		This site is a really simple, single-page AngularJS application. I used Angular because I've used it before, and it's really easy to set up a multi-route, multi-view application with page and data templates. In this case, it's all just static HTML templates, but if I was feeling really fun I could make it all data templates and make the data JSON. Because JSON.
