            Build and update Angular views, controllers, services, templates, directives, filters, and resources for two complex single-page applications used to track medications as they move through hospitals. Aggressively refactor inefficient or poorly-designed code to keep quality high and to ensure future maintainability. Sometimes the API team even lets me write a little Ruby when they are busy. Submit pull requests with pictures of kittens as enticement for reviews. Peer review pull requests submitted by other members of the team, and approve with GIFs (not JIFs) of cats or disapprove with looks of disapproval, insightful commentary, and sometimes ridicule. Travel to customer sites and observe/study users in their natural habitats (usually pharmacy for pharmacists, operating rooms for anesthesiologists) to better understand their work environments, workflows, tech-savvy-ness, and education.

        <p>
            Make cool things and stuff for touch screens (from tablets and phones all the way up to giant multi-touch displays). <strong>VISUALIZE ALL THE DATA</strong>. Study end users and make personas. Spend hours considering and discussing the position and/or color of buttons, menus, text, and many other interface components. Demo our software to customers, users, and prospective employees. Maintain code quality by always using curly braces and a lint brush. Organize and plan recruiting events, and recruit the unwilling. Interview people and ask hard questions to help hire cool people, growing a new office from two to ten people. Draw on whiteboards (usually workflows, architectures, and/or UI mockups; sometimes bacon). Assemble furniture. Disassemble furniture so new employees have to assemble furniture on their first day. Be the keeper of the company website, updating it when things change. Fix the kegerator when it breaks. Ensure fun/absurd/weird office culture.
