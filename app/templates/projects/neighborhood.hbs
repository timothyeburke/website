        Often I find myself wandering around DC and find myself in a neighborhood that I am not entirely familiar with. Google Maps is useful, but doesn't do well at knowing most of the neighborhoods in DC - their data is really rough and only covers the most popular areas. I threw this small webapp together using some polygons for the various DC neighborhoods and the geospatial coordinates returned by the browser. It's meant to be saved as a web link or web app on your phone so you can look up where you are.
