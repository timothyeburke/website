    <h1>Hi there!</h1>
    <p>
        I'm Tim and I make great software and compelling user experiences
        through thoughtful user interface and interaction design, plus lots of
        cool code. I make finance and data visualization software for the research
        faculty of <a href="http://www.cornell.edu">Cornell University</a>.
        Previously I've held roles doing full stack development and user experience
        work at companies like
        <a href="http://marianatek.com" target="_blank">Mariana Tek</a>,
        <a href="http://www.kitcheck.com" target="_blank">Kit Check</a>,
        <a href="http://www.ringtaildesign.com" target="_blank">Ringtail Design</a>,
        and the <a href="http://www.jhuapl.edu/" target="_blank">Johns Hopkins
        University Applied Physics Laboratory</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        My areas of interest include user interface development, data
        visualization, the user experience process, human computer interaction,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kitten" target="_blank">kittens</a>,
        dodging cars on my bicycle, and knitting.
